## eXist implementation for EXPath Cryptographic Module

### Currently implemented functions

*   crypto:hash()
*   crypto:hmac() (only for xs:string data for now)
*   crypto:encrypt() (only for xs:string data and symmetric encryption for now)
*   crypto:decrypt() (only for xs:string data and symmetric decryption for now)
*   crypto:generate-signature() (only for XML data for now)
*   crypto:validate-signature() (only for XML data for now)

### Currently implemented algorithms

*   For crypto:hash(): "MD5", "SHA-1", "SHA-256", "SHA-384", "SHA-512".
*   For crypto:hmac(): "HMAC-MD5", "HMAC-SHA-1", "HMAC-SHA-256", "HMAC-SHA-384", "HMAC-SHA-512".

### Documentation
